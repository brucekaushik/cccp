# Origin Story

CCCP didn't start as a file format — it started as a thought.

While working deeply with regular expressions, I began noticing performance and clarity limitations. That nudged me toward thinking about optimization strategies, which quickly led me into the world of streams — how data flows, transforms, and becomes meaning.

From there, the path naturally pointed to compression: how to represent meaning using fewer bits without losing structure. So I started playing with bits directly, exploring how much can be done with very little — if done right.

At this stage, the idea of composability became central. Could I design a system where encoding, decoding, substitution, transformation — all could be built from small, chainable, understandable parts?

That's when the core ideas behind CCCP clicked into place.
