# CCCP: Context-Aware Composable Compression Protocol

*Composable Compression & Canonical Packing for Interpretable Encoding Pipelines*

**Version:** `0.1`

## 🧭 Overview

**CCCP** is a meta-compression protocol and intermediate representation (IR) framework designed to enable structured, reversible, and pluggable compression workflows. It provides a vendor-extensible way to interpret and transform data before optional final compression, making it ideal for domain-specific encoding, layered processing, or intelligent substitution.

> CCCP is not just a codec — it's a programmable, stage-based protocol for partial or full transformation of data into compact, structured forms.

## 💡 Core Concepts

### ✅ Structured Interpretation

CCCP splits content into meaningful, vendor-defined segments. Some segments may be substituted via LUTs (lookup tables), others left intact — all tagged and ordered.

### 🔁 Reversibility & Optional Final Compression

CCCP allows progressive encoding: raw → IR → compact textual → full binary. At every stage, decoding remains possible. Final compression is optional (e.g., gzip).

### 🧩 Vendor Extensibility

Third-party vendors can define transformations like LUT substitutions, filters, and custom encoders. CCCP segments reference these via scoped, versioned identifiers.

### 🧠 Context-Aware by Design

While CCCP itself does not interpret content natively, it enables **context-aware compression** by allowing vendor-defined logic to determine how tokens are transformed. For example, a LUT might know that "cat" and "lion" belong to the same semantic category and substitute accordingly.

## 🔁 CCCP Pipeline

The standard CCCP pipeline transforms raw input into a compressed binary using the following stages:

```
Raw Input (Text / Image / Data)

       ↓ ↑

Intermediate Representation (IR)
(as many stages as needed)

       ↓ ↑

Final Binary Output
```

Each stage serves a distinct purpose:

1. **Raw Input**: Unstructured or loosely structured source data (e.g. `"cat dog keyboard lion"`).

2. **Intermediate Representation (IR)**: A symbolic, structured, and often *inflated* form. While IR may resemble a partially-encoded format, its primary role is **clarity, transformation flexibility, and round-trippability**.

3. **Final Binary Output**: The fully packed, bit-aligned binary stream. This is the true distribution format, optimized for storage, bandwidth, and optionally layered compression (e.g., via `gzip`, `zstd`).

> **Note**: The IR stage may contain redundant or verbose representations to support readability, transformation logic, or debugging. Compression is not always the goal at this stage — it typically becomes a priority in the final binary output. In fact, compression may be entirely optional, as CCCP can be used purely to standardize or encode parts of a document in consistent, vendor-defined ways.

For entropy analysis, LUT resolution, and cross-vendor encoding/decoding, please refer to the specification index.

## 📄 Example: From Text to IR

Once the input enters the CCCP pipeline, the first transformation stage produces an **Intermediate Representation (IR)**. Below is a simple example of how this process works for a plain text input.

---

### 📝 **Input Text**

```
cat dog keyboard lion
```

---

### 🧠 Transformation Logic

Assume that we use a vendor-defined transformation — `Knolbay:Zoo@1.0.0` — which includes a Lookup Table (LUT) to encode some known words into compact binary symbols.

The encoder processes the input as follows:

* `"cat dog"` → transformed via LUT
* `"keyboard"` → left untransformed (excluded)
* `"lion"` → transformed via LUT

---

### 📦 **Generated IR**

```json
{
  "version": "0.1",
  "headers": [
    ["H1", "Exclude"],
    ["H2", "NewLine"],
    ["H3", "ContinuousSpaces"],
    ["H4", "Knolbay:Zoo@1.0.0"]
  ],
  "segments": [
    ["H3", 8, "01001000"],    // Encoded "cat dog"
    ["H1", 64, "keyboard"],   // Left as-is
    ["H3", 2, "11"]           // Encoded "lion"
  ]
}
```

* This IR is symbolic and partially encoded. It can still be inspected, transformed, or debugged before being finalized as binary.
* Any IR stage can also be reversed or decoded — making the pipeline round-trippable.
* The encoded bits can be represented in more compact ways, please refer to the PoC for an example.

---

### 📟 **LUT and Metadata**

To produce the encoded payloads for segments 1 (`"01001000"`) and segment 3 (`"11"`), the encoder relies on the following LUT and metadata:

#### 📂 LUT Metadata

```json
{
  "sign": "Knolbay:Poc1@1.0.0",
  "vendor": "Knolbay",
  "name": "Zoo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "symbol_width": 2,
  "scheme": "bitstr"
}
```

#### 🔠 LUT Map

```json
{
  " ": "00",
  "cat": "01",
  "dog": "10",
  "lion": "11"
}
```

---

### 📦 Installing the Transformation

The transformation logic (LUT, metadata, codec handlers) can be installed using:

```bash
cccp install Knolbay:Poc1@1.0.0
```

> **Note**: While this example uses a LUT-based transformation, vendors are free to define custom transformation logic with or without a LUT — including statistical encoders, domain-specific grammars, or stream-based filters.

## 📦 Intermediate Representation Format

A CCCP document in its intermediate form (IR) captures a structured, partially-transformed version of the data using symbolic headers and segment definitions. This format allows both human-readable inspection and flexible transformation across encoding stages.

```json
{
  "version": "0.1",
  "headers": [
    ["H1", "Exclude"],
    ["H2", "NewLine"],
    ["H3", "ContinuousSpaces"],
    ["H4", "Knolbay:Zoo@1.0.0"]
  ],
  "segments": [
    ["H3", 8, "01001000"],
    ["H1", 64, "keyboard"],
    ["H3", 2, "11"]
  ]
}
```

### `headers`: Symbolic Transformation Mapping

- An **ordered list** of `[HeaderCode, Transformation]` pairs.
- Each `HeaderCode` (e.g., "H1", "H2") maps to either a standard transformation or a vendor defined one.
- Transformation values may be:
  - Built-in instructions (e.g., `"NewLine"`)
  - Vendor-defined handlers (e.g., `"Knolbay:Zoo@1.0.0"`)

### `segments`: Ordered Payload Instructions

- A list of `[HeaderCode, PayloadBitLength, Payload]` triplets.
- `HeaderCode`: Refers to the transformation rule from `headers`.
- `PayloadBitLength`: Indicates how many **bits** the transformed payload is expected to occupy in the final binary.
  - This is used by the decoder to read the exact number of bits for the segment
  - This value may be set to `0` if the encoder & decoder do not need to use it (e.g., when a delimiter like a newline is sufficient to determine boundaries).
  - Interpretation and enforcement of this field may vary depending on SDK behavior.
- `Payload`: The value to be interpreted using the associated transformation. In IR form, this can be raw text, symbolic form, or pre-encoded binary - depending on the transformation. In the final binary, this will always be fully binary.

### Final Binary Form

* Binary packing of header tags and bit sequences
* Suitable for further compression via tools like `gzip`
* More details might be added to this section later, for now please refer to the PoC.

## 🥃 Open Sourcing My Thoughts (On the Rocks)

The formal docs are still aging in the barrel. POCs? Brewing. In the meantime, I’m open sourcing my thoughts — raw, unfiltered, and possibly discussed under the influence of coffee or something stronger. Sip responsibly.

Some of these ideas might be directionally wrong, totally wild, or just halfway there — but that’s part of the fun.
